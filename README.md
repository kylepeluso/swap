# swap

This is an internal Chrome Extension that is intended to be used for performing QA and health checks on Freestar integrations.

## Setup

1. You must use node v10+. If using nvm, use the following command `nvm use 16`
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run watch:dev` - this runs the build and will update the app automatically every time a file is saved.
4. When loading the file locally, use `dist` folder as the unpacked directory when you add the extension to your Chrome browser.
